        <p>
             We are aware about how everyone has their own body characteristics and each one of us cannot follow a generalized diet plan.
             While planning meals for your body, it is often stressed upon that one must understand their body better and customise their meals accordingly.
             This is why health experts insist that when it comes to nutrition, one size doesn't fit all and
             one needs a customised meal plan to see the results they want.
             So we aim to make a customized diet plan for each one of you on the basis of your individual body type.
