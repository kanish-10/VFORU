        <p>Are you looking for the best Indian Diet Plan to lose weight? The rules are simple.
            </p>
            <p>All you need to do is start eating right food. However, in India, this can feel like an insurmountable challenge, given our food culture and dietary habits.</p>
            <p> For instance, a typical Indian meal is high in carbohydrates and sugar – we eat a lot of potatoes, rice, and sweets.</p>
            <p>We also love our snacks and can’t imagine a day without our fix of namkeens and bhujias.</p>
            <p> Even we encourage our friends and family into eating more, as a sign of hospitality and affection, and consider refusing, an extra helping a rebuff.</p>
            <p>To top it all, we’ve never embraced physical exercise as essential.</p><p> So, it isn’t a surprise that India is battling with a growing problem of Unhealthy Lifestyle.</p>
